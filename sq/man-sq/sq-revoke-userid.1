.SH NAME
userid \- Revoke a User ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBuserid\fR [\fB\-\-certificate\fR] [\fB\-\-revocation\-key\fR] [\fB\-\-private\-key\-store\fR] [\fB\-t\fR|\fB\-\-time\fR] [\fB\-\-notation\fR] [\fB\-B\fR|\fB\-\-binary\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] <\fIUSERID\fR> <\fIREASON\fR> <\fIMESSAGE\fR> 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Revokes a User ID
.PP
Creates a revocation certificate for a User ID.
.PP
If "\-\-revocation\-key" is provided, then that key is used to create the signature.  If that key is different from the certificate being revoked, this creates a third\-party revocation.  This is normally only useful if the owner of the certificate designated the key to be a designated revoker.
.PP
If "\-\-revocation\-key" is not provided, then the certificate must include a certification\-capable key.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-certificate\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Reads the certificate to revoke from FILE or stdin, if omitted.  It is an error for the file to contain more than one certificate.
.TP
\fB\-\-revocation\-key\fR=\fIKEY\fR
Signs the revocation certificate using KEY.  If the key is different from the certificate, this creates a third\-party revocation.  If this option is not provided, and the certificate includes secret key material, then that key is used to sign the revocation certificate.
.TP
\fB\-\-private\-key\-store\fR=\fIKEY_STORE\fR
Provides parameters for private key store
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR=\fITIME\fR
Chooses keys valid at the specified time and sets the revocation certificate\*(Aqs creation time
.TP
\fB\-\-notation\fR=\fINAME VALUE\fR
Adds a notation to the certification.  A user\-defined notation\*(Aqs name must be of the form "name@a.domain.you.control.org". If the notation\*(Aqs name starts with a !, then the notation is marked as being critical.  If a consumer of a signature doesn\*(Aqt understand a critical notation, then it will ignore the signature.  The notation is marked as being human readable.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
Emits binary data
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help information
.TP
<\fIUSERID\fR>
The User ID to revoke.  By default, this must exactly match a self\-signed User ID.  Use \-\-force to generate a revocation certificate for a User ID, which is not self signed.
.TP
<\fIREASON\fR>
The reason for the revocation.  This must be either: retired, or unspecified:

  \- retired means that this User ID is no longer valid.  This is
    appropriate when someone leaves an organisation, and the
    organisation does not have their secret key material.  For
    instance, if someone was part of Debian and retires, they would
    use this to indicate that a Debian\-specific User ID is no longer
    valid.

  \- unspecified means that a different reason applies.

If the reason happened in the past, you should specify that using the \-\-time argument.  This allows OpenPGP implementations to more accurately reason about objects whose validity depends on the validity of a User ID.
.TP
<\fIMESSAGE\fR>
A short, explanatory text that is shown to a viewer of the revocation certificate.  It explains why the certificate has been revoked.  For instance, if Alice has created a new key, she would generate a \*(Aqsuperseded\*(Aq revocation certificate for her old key, and might include the message "I\*(Aqve created a new certificate, FINGERPRINT, please use that in the future."
